### Pewlett-hackard_Analysis
#### Overview
This analysis was created to help Pewlett Hackard understand how their workforce would be changing in the next few years as the baby boomer generation begins to retire and new people enter the company. The second part of the analysis was done to show who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help new hires excel in the company.
#### Results 
* The first thing that stands out when looking at the retiring_titles table is that mostly senior-level employees are retiring. The total count of staff eligible for retirement that have the word senior in their title is 50,842, compared to the 21,616 non-senior-level employees. That's a little over double the amount.
* Another thing that stands out is that management is not going to lose a lot of employees. They only have two employees up for retirement.
* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
* Of the 1,549 eligible employees, 729 are senior-level employees.

#### Summary
###### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
From looking at the above tables, you can see that 72,458 employees in the company are eligible for retirement. The "silver tsunami" will have a significant impact on the company. The majority of vacancies will be in the production and development section of the company, but no area is left without loss.

###### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are significantly fewer mentorship-eligible employees in the company right now compared to the number that will be leaving. Although each person may be able to take more than one mentee at a time, they will be stretched very thin. Although the departments that are losing the most people do have the largest number of potential mentors, there are not enough people to mentor the next wave of employees. If you take the development group as an example, each person would have to mentor 21 people on average. The program may need to expand the credentials to ensure there are enough mentors to cover all new employees.
