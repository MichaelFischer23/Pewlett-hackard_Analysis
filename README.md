### Pewlett-hackard_Analysis
#### Overview
This analysis was created to help Pewlett Hackard understand how their workforce would be changing in the next few years
as the baby boomer generation begins to retire and new people are beginning to enter into the company. The second part of the 
analysis was done to show who was eligible to participating in a mentorship program to help the new hires excel in the company.
#### Results 
* The first thing that stands out when looking at the retiring_titles table is that it is mostly senior level employees that are retiring. The total count of staff eligible for retiring that have the word senior in their title is 50,842 compared to the 21,616 non-senior level employees. That's a little over double the amount.
* Another thing that stands out is that management is not going to be losing a lot of employees. They only have two employees up for retirment.
* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
* Of the 1,549 eligible employees 729 are senior level employees

###### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are significantly less mentorship eligible employees in the company right now compared to the number that will be leaving. Although each person may be able to take
more than one mentor at a time they will be streched very thin. ![mentor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105613428/180627219-531efbdd-68cc-422c-a50b-ac437d5277dc.PNG)
